    "### **1.1 Limitations of the Classic Supervised Paradigm**\n",
    "\n",
    "Most machine learning systems in production today are built under the supervised learning paradigm. In this context, risk is traditionally understood as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* prediction error;\n",
    "* statistical bias;\n",
    "* out-of-sample misgeneralization;\n",
    "* numerical instability or overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, risk is usually expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{R}{sup} = \\mathbb{E}{(x,y)\\sim \\mathcal{D}}[\\ell(f(x), y)]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $f(x)$ it's the model;\n",
    "* $y$ It's the real label.;\n",
    "* $\\ell(\\cdot)$ It is a loss function;\n",
    "* $\\mathcal{D}$ It is the distribution of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although powerful, this formalism implicitly assumes that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the environment is **static;**\n",
    "2. the model is **passive;**\n",
    "3. there is no feedback between decisions and future data;\n",
    "4. supervision is complete and reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These assumptions cease to be valid as systems become:\n",
    "\n",
    "* interactive;\n",
    "* adaptive;\n",
    "* multi-stage;\n",
    "* partially supervised.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.2 Emergence of Autonomous Risk**\n",
    "\n",
    "Autonomous risk is defined as a risk that cannot be reduced solely by improvements in predictive accuracy, as it emerges from the system's behavior over time, and not from a single isolated decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike classic supervised risk, autonomous risk arises when:\n",
    "\n",
    "* decisions influence the future state of the system;\n",
    "* the model begins to operate in feedback loops;\n",
    "* there is freedom of action under incomplete constraints;\n",
    "* the system optimizes proxy metrics instead of real objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, autonomous risk can be expressed as a state function:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{R}_{aut}(t) = f\\big(A(t), O(t), S(t), H(t)\\big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $A(t)$ represents the degree of decisional autonomy;\n",
    "* $O(t)$ represents internal opacity / complexity;\n",
    "* $S(t)$ represents strategic optimization capability;\n",
    "* $H(t)$) represents the level of effective human supervision.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.3 Why Accuracy Is Not Enough?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A system may exhibit:\n",
    "\n",
    "* high AUC;\n",
    "* low mean error;\n",
    "* good calibration.\n",
    "\n",
    "And yet:\n",
    "\n",
    "* develop opportunistic behaviors;\n",
    "* exploit gaps in supervision;\n",
    "* mask risky decisions;\n",
    "* adapt to avoid penalties without reducing real risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This phenomenon has already been observed in:\n",
    "\n",
    "* credit systems;\n",
    "* recommendation engines;\n",
    "* anti-fraud systems;\n",
    "* dynamic pricing algorithms.\n",
    "\n",

    "> **High accuracy does not imply security.**\n",
    "\n",

    "### **1.4 Fundamental Difference Between Error and Behavior**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the classical paradigm, risk is associated with **errors.**\n",

    "The central implication of this section can be summarized in one sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Risk is not just a property of the model, but of the operating system.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, any serious approach to security in advanced systems must:\n",

    "\n",
    "A fundamental inflection point occurs when a system ceases to be a **point classifier** and begins to act as a **time-agent.**\n",

    "In multi-step systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "* current decisions alter future states;\n",
    "* the history of interactions influences subsequent actions;\n",
    "* the objective is not only to predict, but to **plan.**\n",

    "\n",
    "The introduction of **memory** profoundly transforms the risk profile of the system.\n",

    "\n",
    "* contextual adaptation;\n",
    "* recognition of temporal patterns;\n",

    "### **2.3 Planejamento como Amplificador de Risco**\n",
    "\n",
    "Planning is the ability to **evaluate future consequences before acting.**\n",

    "* $R$ It is the reward function;\n",
    "* $\\gamma$ It is the discount factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The critical point is that **the system does not optimize the real objective,** but rather **the reward that is provided to it.**\n",

    "This creates room for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* reward hacking;\n",
    "* metrics gaming;\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.4 Temporal Risk and Dynamic Coupling**\n",
    "\n",
    "In multi-stage systems, risk ceases to be instantaneous and becomes **temporally coupled.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can express the accumulated risk as:\n",

    "$$\\mathcal{R}{traj} = \\sum{t=0}^{T} \\mathcal{R}_{aut}(t)$$\n",
