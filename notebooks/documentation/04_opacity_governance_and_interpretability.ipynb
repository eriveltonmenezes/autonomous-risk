    "\n",
    "Opacity is not merely the absence of interpretability tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the **structural inability to reliably infer why a system behaves the way it does,** even when its outputs are observable.\n",
    "\n",

    "* the **observable behavior** of the system, and;\n",

    "* inputs and outputs;\n",
    "* training data;\n",
    "* model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.2 Distinguishing Opacity from Complexity**\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity and opacity are related but not equivalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A system may be complex but transparent (e.g., a large but well-understood linear model);\n",
    "* A system may be opaque despite moderate complexity (e.g., ensembles or deep nonlinear interactions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Opacity arises when:\n",
    "\n",
    "* feature interactions are non-intuitive;\n",
    "* internal representations are distributed;\n",
    "* decision pathways are non-identifiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, opacity is **epistemic,** not merely computational.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.3 Dimensions of Opacity**\n",
    "\n",
    "We decompose opacity into three interacting dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**a) Structural Opacity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Nonlinear interactions;\n",
    "* High-order feature dependencies;\n",
    "* Distributed internal representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b) Statistical Opacity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sensitivity to small perturbations;\n",
    "* Instability under resampling;\n",
    "* Multiple equivalent decision boundaries.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "A system may be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* highly confident;\n",
    "* highly accurate;\n",
    "* and deeply opaque.\n",
    "\n",
    "This combination is particularly dangerous in high-stakes domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.5 Why Post-hoc Explainability Is Insufficient**\n",
    "\n",
    "Post-hoc tools (e.g., SHAP, LIME) provide **local approximations** of model behavior.\n",
    "They do **not:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* reveal global causal structure;\n",
    "* detect emergent internal objectives;\n",
    "* guarantee stability under intervention.\n",
    "\n",

    "This notebook operationalizes the concept of autonomous risk through a set of empirically observable proxies designed to preserve the structural relationships articulated in the theoretical framework. Rather than attempting to exhaustively instantiate all dimensions of autonomy, opacity, supervision, and instability, the empirical strategy prioritizes minimally sufficient indicators capable of capturing how these dimensions interact in practice under realistic deployment conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each construct is treated as a system-level property rather than a psychological or intentional attribute. The objective is not to infer internal motivations or strategic intent, but to diagnose how structural characteristics of intelligent systems can give rise to emergent risk even when conventional performance indicators remain stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Autonomy $(A)$:** is operationalized as decisional independence, reflected in the system’s capacity to generate and persist in predictions without immediate external correction. In the present implementation, autonomy is proxied through model confidence, probability sharpness, and stability of decision outputs across perturbations. These measures capture the degree to which the system effectively acts on its own outputs rather than being continuously constrained by supervisory intervention;\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Opacity $(O)$:** is treated as a structural property of the model, representing the extent to which internal decision logic becomes inaccessible to external inspection. Empirically, opacity is proxied through variance-based measures derived from SHAP value distributions. Higher variance in feature attributions across observations indicates fragmented or unstable internal representations, increasing the difficulty of governance and oversight. This proxy does not assume that opacity is reducible to any single interpretability score, but rather reflects informational asymmetry between the system and its supervisors;\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Supervision $(H)$:** is modeled as the effective availability of external oversight, including human review capacity, audit triggers, and corrective intervention mechanisms. In this notebook, supervision is treated as a bounded and degradable resource, whose influence diminishes as system speed, complexity, and decision density increase. Empirical proxies reflect supervision intensity indirectly, through constraints applied to autonomous behavior and the normalization of instability signals;\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Instability $(S)$:** captures the system’s susceptibility to amplification under feedback and perturbation. It is instantiated via observable stress signals, including predictive entropy, output variability, and drift-related indicators. Multiple representations of instability are retained for analytical clarity: a raw instability signal $(S_{\\mathrm{raw}})$, a normalized instability index $(S_{\\mathrm{norm}})$ enabling comparability across settings, and a log-scaled transformation $\\log(1+S)$ that reflects diminishing marginal sensitivity under high-instability regimes. These representations serve distinct analytical purposes without altering the underlying construct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, these proxies are not treated as exhaustive or exclusive representations of their respective constructs. They are deliberately chosen to be observable, reproducible, and sufficient to test the core hypothesis of the framework: that autonomous risk emerges from the interaction between autonomy, opacity, supervision, and instability, rather than from isolated failures or declines in predictive accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "By grounding each construct in minimally sufficient empirical signals, the framework remains extensible to alternative models, domains, and anomaly detection techniques, while preserving a stable conceptual core. This design choice ensures that empirical findings reflect structural properties of autonomous systems rather than artifacts of any specific modeling architecture.\n"

    "### **3.1 Quantifying Opacity: Operational Proxies**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Need for Proxies**\n",
    "\n",
    "Opacity, as employed in this project, is not treated as a directly observable or ontologically primitive quantity. Rather, it is understood as a structural property of intelligent systems, reflecting the degree to which internal decision processes become inaccessible, non-interpretable, or weakly coupled to external supervisory mechanisms. Because such properties cannot be measured directly, opacity must be approached through empirical proxies that capture observable consequences of internal complexity, informational asymmetry, and interpretability limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, these proxies are not assumed to exhaustively define opacity, nor to constitute a ground-truth representation of the construct. Their role is diagnostic and instrumental: to approximate different facets of structural opacity in ways that are empirically tractable, reproducible, and relevant to governance analysis. This distinction is critical to avoid conflating empirical observability with conceptual completeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this section is therefore not to redefine opacity empirically, but to systematically explore candidate proxies that reflect how opacity manifests operationally in learning systems under autonomous constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.2 Proxy I: Prediction Instability**\n",
    "\n",
    "Prediction instability captures the sensitivity of model outputs to small perturbations in input data or internal states. High variability in predicted probabilities under minimal input variation suggests that decision boundaries are brittle, internally complex, or poorly aligned with interpretable features.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a proxy for opacity, prediction instability does not indicate lack of accuracy per se, but rather difficulty in establishing a stable explanatory relationship between inputs and outputs. Systems exhibiting high predictive volatility may remain performant on aggregate metrics while becoming increasingly opaque to external inspection, especially under distributional shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "This proxy is therefore interpreted as an indirect indicator of internal decision complexity rather than as a measure of uncertainty or error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.3 Proxy II: Explanation Variability (SHAP Variance)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation variability, operationalized through the variance of SHAP value contributions across samples and decision contexts, constitutes the primary opacity proxy used in the article and empirical analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "High SHAP variance indicates that feature attributions fluctuate significantly across similar inputs or decision regimes, suggesting that the model relies on context-dependent internal representations that resist stable explanation. This instability in attribution undermines the ability of auditors or supervisors to form reliable mental models of system behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, explanation variability can increase even when predictive accuracy and calibration remain stable. For this reason, SHAP variance is particularly well-suited as a governance-relevant proxy for opacity: it captures the erosion of interpretability without conflating it with performance degradation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.4 Proxy III: Uncertainty Divergence**\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertainty divergence measures the discrepancy between different internal uncertainty estimates (e.g., predictive entropy, confidence scores, ensemble disagreement). When these signals diverge, it indicates that the system lacks a coherent internal representation of its own epistemic state.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an opacity proxy, uncertainty divergence reflects internal inconsistency rather than noise. Systems exhibiting high divergence may present confident outputs while internally oscillating between incompatible representations, making external oversight difficult and potentially misleading.\n",
    "\n",
    "This proxy complements explanation variability by capturing opacity arising from epistemic fragmentation rather than attribution instability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.5 Proxy IV: Drift Sensitivity**\n",
    "\n",
    "Drift sensitivity captures how rapidly model behavior changes in response to distributional shift over time. Systems that exhibit sharp behavioral transitions under mild drift are often internally brittle or highly specialized, relying on representations that do not generalize smoothly.\n",
    "\n",
    "While drift itself is treated elsewhere as a component of instability (S), drift sensitivity is interpreted here as an opacity-related phenomenon: it reflects how hidden internal dependencies amplify small environmental changes into large behavioral shifts that are difficult to anticipate or interpret externally.\n",
    "\n",
    "This distinction prevents conceptual overlap between opacity (O) and instability (S), while preserving their empirical interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.6 Composite Opacity Index (O)**\n",
    "\n",
    "To support empirical analysis, the individual proxies described above are aggregated into a composite opacity index, denoted as O. This index is constructed as a weighted combination of selected proxies, chosen for their empirical observability and relevance to governance diagnostics within the scope of this study.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is essential to emphasize that O is not treated as a definitive or exhaustive measure of opacity. Rather, it functions as a pragmatic operational convention, enabling comparative analysis across models, regimes, and autonomy levels. Different proxy selections or weighting schemes may be appropriate in other contexts without undermining the conceptual framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accordingly, opacity is not assumed to reside in the numerical value of O itself, but in the structural conditions that give rise to elevated proxy signals. The index serves as a lens through which opacity-related dynamics can be systematically explored, not as a claim of ontological completeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.7 Interpretation and Limits**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each proxy introduced in this section captures a distinct manifestation of opacity, and none should be interpreted in isolation. Prediction instability reflects sensitivity, explanation variability reflects interpretability erosion, uncertainty divergence reflects epistemic incoherence, and drift sensitivity reflects hidden structural fragility.\n",
    "\n",
    "These proxies are neither interchangeable nor exhaustive. Their value lies in triangulation: when multiple proxies align, confidence increases that the system is operating in an opaque regime relevant to governance concerns. Conversely, divergence between proxies can itself be diagnostically informative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recognizing these limits is essential to prevent overinterpretation and to maintain epistemic humility in governance-oriented analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.8 Transition to Empirical Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "The opacity proxies defined in this section provide the empirical foundation for subsequent analyses of autonomous risk, governance erosion, and instability amplification. In the empirical notebooks that follow, selected proxies (most notably SHAP variance) are instantiated within simulated and real-world-inspired decision environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "These operationalizations enable the study of how opacity interacts with autonomy, supervision, and instability over time, without collapsing complex structural properties into simplistic scalar judgments. The transition from proxy definition to empirical analysis thus preserves conceptual integrity while enabling quantitative investigation.\n"

    "### **4.1 Overview and Methodological Scope**\n",
    "\n",
    "This section presents the empirical estimation of opacity and its interaction with autonomy, supervision, and instability within controlled decision environments. The objective is not to validate opacity as an intrinsic property of specific models, but to demonstrate how opacity-related signals emerge, evolve, and interact with governance-relevant variables under increasing autonomy.\n",
    "\n",
    "All empirical results should therefore be interpreted as diagnostic illustrations, not as claims of universal model behavior. The emphasis is on structural dynamics rather than on benchmark performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.2 Experimental Setup**\n",
    "\n",
    "The empirical analysis is conducted using simulated decision trajectories inspired by credit risk and antifraud environments, where intelligent systems operate under varying degrees of autonomy and supervision. Models are trained on nominal data distributions and subsequently exposed to controlled perturbations, drift, and feedback loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key experimental dimensions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Gradual increases in decisional autonomy (A);\n",
    "* Progressive weakening or saturation of human supervision (H);\n",
    "* Controlled introduction of distributional drift and feedback;\n",
    "* Measurement of opacity proxies, instability signals, and governance stress indicators across time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup allows the system to remain locally performant while exploring regimes in which structural risks may accumulate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.3 Estimation of Opacity Proxies**\n",
    "\n",
    "Opacity is empirically estimated using the proxies defined in Section 3, with primary emphasis on explanation variability as measured through SHAP value variance. Secondary proxies (including prediction instability, uncertainty divergence, and drift sensitivity) are used for triangulation and robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each experimental regime, opacity proxies are computed over rolling windows of decision trajectories, enabling the observation of temporal trends rather than isolated measurements. This temporal perspective is critical, as opacity is hypothesized to emerge gradually as a function of internal adaptation and autonomy, rather than as an abrupt transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.4 Interaction with Autonomy and Supervision**\n",
    "\n",
    "Empirical results reveal that opacity does not increase monotonically with autonomy. Instead, opacity signals intensify most strongly in intermediate regimes of autonomy, where systems are sufficiently independent to adapt behavior, but not yet equipped with stabilizing internal constraints or corrective feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervision exerts a dampening effect on opacity-related signals, but this effect exhibits diminishing returns. As autonomy and decision density increase, supervision increasingly functions as a delayed or symbolic constraint rather than a real-time corrective mechanism.\n",
    "This interaction underscores that opacity is not merely a property of model architecture, but a dynamic outcome of how autonomy and oversight co-evolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.5 Empirical Implications for Governance**\n",
    "\n",
    "From a governance perspective, the empirical findings demonstrate that opacity can intensify even when conventional performance metrics remain stable. Systems may appear accurate, calibrated, and compliant while simultaneously becoming less interpretable and less governable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This disconnect challenges governance frameworks that rely on static interpretability artifacts or episodic audits. Empirical estimation of opacity proxies provides early warning signals of structural risk that would otherwise remain undetected until failure or harm becomes observable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.6 Limitations of Empirical Estimation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The empirical estimation presented here is subject to several limitations. Proxy selection and weighting schemes are necessarily context-dependent, and alternative operationalizations may yield different quantitative patterns. Moreover, simulated environments cannot capture the full complexity of real-world sociotechnical systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "These limitations do not undermine the framework’s validity, but rather reinforce its diagnostic intent. The goal is not to exhaustively measure opacity, but to render its dynamics observable and governable.\n"

    "The empirical patterns observed in this notebook demonstrate that opacity is not merely a technical artifact related to model complexity or explainability limitations, but a structural condition that directly shapes the effectiveness of governance and supervision in autonomous systems. Across the analyzed scenarios, increases in opacity consistently correlate with delayed detectability of instability, reduced corrective leverage, and the emergence of behavior that remains locally performant while becoming globally fragile.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, opacity does not operate as an isolated risk factor. Its governance relevance arises from its interaction with autonomy and supervision. When decision-making autonomy increases under conditions of high opacity, the system’s internal dynamics become progressively decoupled from external oversight. Supervisory mechanisms may remain formally present, yet functionally ineffective, as the informational asymmetry between system behavior and human understanding widens. In this regime, governance failure is not triggered by overt malfunction, but by the erosion of meaningful intervention capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results further indicate that opacity amplifies the temporal dimension of risk. Rather than producing immediate and observable errors, opaque systems tend to accumulate instability silently across decision trajectories. This accumulation manifests as increasing volatility, drift sensitivity, and divergence in explanation structures, all while conventional performance metrics remain stable. From a governance perspective, this implies that opacity transforms risk from an event-based phenomenon into a trajectory-based one, rendering episodic audits and static validation insufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings challenge governance models that equate transparency with post hoc interpretability or documentation completeness. Even when explanations are technically available, high variability in attribution structures and instability-sensitive responses can undermine their operational usefulness. In such cases, explanations function more as symbolic assurances than as actionable control instruments. Governance, therefore, cannot rely solely on interpretability artifacts, but must account for how opacity evolves dynamically as systems adapt and scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a regulatory standpoint, opacity should be understood as a stressor on governance capacity. As opacity increases, the same level of supervision yields diminishing returns, effectively degrading human oversight as a finite resource. This degradation becomes particularly acute in environments characterized by high decision density and feedback-driven optimization, where the speed of internal adaptation exceeds the cadence of human review.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this light, opacity emerges as a critical mediator between autonomy and loss of control. It delineates the boundary at which systems transition from being supervised tools to becoming operationally autonomous entities whose internal dynamics escape timely human correction. The governance challenge, therefore, is not to eliminate opacity (an unrealistic goal in complex systems) but to detect when opacity begins to compromise controllability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the interpretation advanced here aligns with the central claim of the broader framework: dangerous system behavior can emerge without failure, misalignment, or malicious intent. Opacity contributes to this outcome by obscuring early warning signals and delaying intervention until corrective action becomes structurally constrained. Effective governance must therefore incorporate opacity-aware diagnostics that monitor not only what a system decides, but how its internal dynamics evolve relative to human supervisory capacity.\n"

    "\n",
    "Most regulatory and technical frameworks focus on **model risk**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* bias;\n",
    "* overfitting;\n",
    "* lack of interpretability;\n",
    "* performance degradation.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, antifraud systems operating under feedback loops introduce a **higher-order risk**:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Governance risk:** the risk that no actor (human or institutional) can effectively understand, intervene, or redirect system behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "This risk is orthogonal to accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6.2 Why Governance Risk Is Hard to Detect**\n",
    "\n",
    "Governance failures tend to be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* gradual;\n",
    "* distributed;\n",
    "* and masked by stable metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "* dashboards remain green;\n",
    "* KPIs remain within tolerance;\n",
    "* alerts trigger too late.\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates an illusion of control.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6.3 Dimensions of Governance Risk**\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the empirical analysis, governance risk emerges along four dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Opacity accumulation:** Explanations drift faster than decisions;\n",
    "2. **Autonomy amplification:** Feedback loops increase effective independence;\n",
    "3. **Supervisory overload:**  Human operators face too many alerts, explanations, or edge cases;\n",
    "4. **Delayed reversibility:** Once deployed, reversing damage requires retraining, policy changes, or legal action.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6.4 Operationalizing Governance Risk**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define a governance risk proxy:\n",
    "\n",
    "$G = g(O, A, D, H)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $O$: opacity level;\n",
    "* $A$: effective autonomy;\n",
    "* $D$: decision density / velocity;\n",
    "* $H$: human oversight capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Critically:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $D$ increases with automation,\n",
    "* $H$ remains bounded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, governance risk grows superlinearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6.5 Control Is Not the Same as Supervision**\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding more human review does not necessarily restore control.\n",
    "\n",
    "When:\n",
    "\n",
    "* explanations are unstable;\n",
    "* decisions are frequent;\n",
    "* feedback is recursive;\n",
    "\n",
    "human oversight becomes **symbolic**, not effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to **control illusion**:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Humans appear “in the loop” while the system operates beyond meaningful intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6.6 Empirical Evidence from Antifraud Systems**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the experiments:\n",
    "\n",
    "* anomaly detectors flagged regions ignored by supervised models;\n",
    "* retraining shifted decision boundaries without explicit intent;\n",
    "* clusters of rejection emerged without corresponding fraud increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "These patterns reflect governance drift rather than modeling error.\n",

    "### **6.7 Limits of Post-Hoc Explainability**\n",
    "\n",
    "Post-hoc explainability:\n",
    "\n",
    "* explains decisions;\n",
    "* but does not explain **system evolution.**\n",

    "Governance requires:\n",
    "\n",
    "* trajectory-level understanding;\n",
    "* not pointwise explanations.\n",

    "### **6.8 The Governance Threshold**\n",
    "\n",
    "We define a qualitative threshold:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A system crosses the **governance threshold** when its future behavior cannot be reliably predicted or redirected by its operators within operational time constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Crossing this threshold does not require:\n",
    "\n",
    "* consciousness;\n",
    "* intent;\n",
    "* or self-awareness.\n",

    "### **6.9 Implications for Regulation**\n",
    "\n",
    "This reframes regulatory questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. “Is the model unbiased?”\n",
    "2. “Is the accuracy sufficient?”\n",
    "3. “Can the system still be governed?”\n",

    "This work advances the concept of autonomous risk as a structural property of intelligent systems that can emerge independently of explicit technical failure. By formalizing risk as a dynamic interaction between autonomy, opacity, supervision, and instability, the framework shifts the focus of safety and governance from isolated errors to system trajectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Empirical analyses demonstrate that the most dangerous regimes are not those of maximal autonomy, but those of partial autonomy, where systems are free enough to adapt yet insufficiently constrained to self-correct. In these regimes, opacity intensifies, supervision erodes, and instability accumulates beneath apparently stable performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, the results show that governance failure is not an event but a process. Systems do not suddenly become uncontrollable; they drift into states where corrective intervention becomes structurally delayed or ineffective. Conventional oversight mechanisms (grounded in accuracy metrics, static interpretability, and episodic audits) are ill-suited to detect this transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "By operationalizing autonomous risk and opacity through measurable proxies, this work provides a diagnostic lens for identifying dangerous regimes before overt harm occurs. The framework does not claim to predict failure, nor to ascribe intent or agency to systems. Instead, it offers a principled way to reason about when intelligent systems approach the limits of governability.\n",
    "\n",
    "More broadly, the findings suggest that effective AI governance must move beyond binary notions of control and compliance. Adaptive, trajectory-aware oversight mechanisms (capable of responding to evolving autonomy, opacity, and supervision constraints) are essential if intelligent systems are to be deployed safely at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "The contribution of this work lies not in prescribing specific regulatory thresholds, but in articulating the structural conditions under which governance erodes. In doing so, it provides both researchers and practitioners with a foundation for anticipating risk in intelligent systems before failure becomes visible, and before intervention becomes impossible.\n"
