    "Contemporary intelligent systems increasingly operate under conditions of high autonomy, continuous feedback, and large-scale deployment. In such settings, traditional notions of system safety (grounded in accuracy, calibration, and episodic validation) prove insufficient to capture emerging forms of systemic risk. Recent failures in sociotechnical systems demonstrate that harm may arise even when models remain technically correct, statistically performant, and formally compliant with governance standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook establishes the theoretical foundations of Autonomous Risk, a concept introduced to describe how intelligent systems can become structurally dangerous without exhibiting explicit malfunction or performance degradation. The objective is not to attribute intent, deception, or agency to algorithms, but to analyze how autonomy, opacity, feedback, and supervision interact to produce endogenous instability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook serves as the conceptual map for all subsequent empirical notebooks. It defines the epistemological commitments of the project, clarifies what is (and is not) being claimed, and motivates the need for diagnostic tools capable of detecting risk before overt failure occurs."

    "Autonomy in intelligent systems is not a binary property, but a continuous structural condition describing the degree to which a system can initiate, persist, and compound decisions without immediate external correction. As autonomy increases, systems increasingly shape their own future operating conditions through feedback loops, reinforcement effects, and self-generated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In feedback-driven environments, even systems optimized under benign objectives may gradually decouple from supervisory intent. This decoupling does not require deception, misalignment, or adversarial goals. Instead, it emerges when local optimization interacts with delayed or degraded oversight, allowing system dynamics to evolve faster than external corrective mechanisms can respond.\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical feature of such systems is temporal asymmetry. Decisions accumulate effects over time, while supervision is often episodic, retrospective, or symbolic. Under these conditions, control erodes not through abrupt failure, but through gradual structural drift. Systems may remain accurate, calibrated, and compliant, while simultaneously becoming harder to correct, predict, or override.\n",
    "\n",
    "This erosion of control is amplified by opacity. As internal representations grow more complex and decision pathways become less interpretable, supervisory capacity weakens further. The system’s behavior remains locally rational, yet globally fragile. Risk, in this context, is not an event, but a trajectory: something the system becomes rather than something that happens.\n",

    "Autonomous risk is defined as the endogenous amplification of instability arising from the interaction between autonomy, opacity, feedback, and supervision. Unlike conventional risk measures, which focus on prediction error or failure probability, autonomous risk characterizes the structural vulnerability of a system operating under autonomy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, autonomous risk is not an outcome variable to be predicted, nor a label derived from observed harm. It is a diagnostic construct intended to measure how close a system operates to regimes where corrective intervention becomes ineffective.\n",

Empirical and theoretical considerations suggest instead that maximal risk often arises in intermediate regimes, where systems are autonomous enough to act independently, yet insufficiently robust to self-correct or remain governable.\n",

    "Autonomous risk therefore captures a mismatch between system initiative and control capacity. It formalizes the intuition that systems can be too autonomous to supervise easily, but not autonomous enough to be stable.\n"

    "A central contribution of this framework is the clear separation between risk and failure. Failure refers to observable breakdowns: incorrect predictions, constraint violations, or measurable harm. Risk, by contrast, refers to latent conditions under which failure becomes increasingly likely or uncontrollable.\n",

    "In autonomous systems, risk may accumulate while failure remains absent. Systems can operate in a high-risk regime for extended periods without visible error, particularly when performance metrics are optimized locally and feedback is delayed.\n",
